#summary Describes how the 3 states checkboxes work

= Introduction =

AGoTDB uses a custom expandable 3-state checkboxes list.

= Details =

Checkboxes are initially in a compact state.

Hovering with the mouse over it will expand the list, displaying all checkboxes.

You may include choices by left-clicking in the checkbox, making a green "+" sign appear, and exclude choices by right-clicking in it, making a red "-" sign appear. You may cycle through "+", "-" and unselected by clicking many times in the same checkbox.

As soon as the mouse leaves the expanded chechbox list area, it collapses back to a compact state, showing a brief summary of the selected choices.

The choices made are taken into account immediately, displaying the new results in the result windows.

You may clear all the choices of the checkbox by right-clicking on it before it expands. A cleared list is ignored when filtering the results.

Choices within a checkbox list may be inclusive or exclusive, depending on the checkbox. 

The following checkbox lists are inclusive:
  * card type
  * house
  * trigger
  * expansion set
For example, the following selection will perform a search on cards that are either locations or attachments, but are not plots nor agendas.

The following checkbox lists are exclusive:
  * provides gold / income / influence
  * mecanism
  * icon
  * virtue
  * keyword
For example, the following selection will perform a search on cards that have the military and intrigue icon (and may have a power icon or not).

In both case, "-" choices are discriminating.
